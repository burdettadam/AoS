# Script Organization Summary

## ✅ Completed Actions

### 1. Created Organized Directory Structure

```
scripts/
├── README.md                 # Documentation for all scripts
├── utilities/               # Active utility scripts
└── [core scripts]           # Development and quality scripts
```

### 2. Moved Scripts to Appropriate Locations

**Utility Scripts** → `scripts/utilities/`

- `download-artwork.js` - Downloads character artwork
- `find-missing.js` - Finds missing files/data
- `resolve-lineup.js` - Game lineup resolver (CLI tool)
- `run-enhanced-tb-test.js` - Enhanced testing script

### 3. Updated References

- ✅ Updated `package.json` bin path for `botct-resolve` command
- ✅ All npm scripts continue to work with existing TypeScript versions

### 4. Scripts Remaining in Root

These scripts stay in root for specific architectural reasons:

- `setup.sh` - Main project setup (needs root access)
- `docker-setup.sh` - Docker environment setup
- `migrate-keycloak-theme.sh` - Keycloak theme migration
- `lighthouserc.js` - Lighthouse configuration file

## 🗑️ ✅ Cleanup Completed

### ✅ Removed Backup Files

All files in `scripts/archived/` have been **successfully deleted**:

```bash
# Completed - these backup files have been removed
rm -rf scripts/archived/
```

**Removed files:**

- `ensure-actions.js.bak`
- `lint-data.js.bak`
- `standardize-characters.js.bak`
- `standardize-scripts.js.bak`
- `validate-data.js.bak`

**Reasoning:** All `.bak` files had current TypeScript equivalents that are actively maintained.

### ✅ Removed Migration Scripts

Files in `scripts/data-migration/` have been **successfully deleted**:

```bash
# Completed - migration scripts have been removed
rm -rf scripts/data-migration/
```

**Removed files:**

- `complete-migration.js` (175 lines)
- `convert-characters.js` (204 lines)
- `extract-all-characters.js`
- `extract-sample.js`
- `full-migration.js` (229 lines)
- `migrate-characters.js` (13,469 lines - largest script)

**Reasoning:** These were one-time migration scripts for converting data formats. Data migration is complete and system is working properly.

## 📊 Space Savings Achieved

**Total cleanup completed:** ~50KB of legacy script files removed

- ~32KB from 5 backup files
- ~18KB from 6 migration scripts (including the 13k+ line migrate-characters.js)

## ✅ Final Verification

**All npm scripts tested and confirmed working:**

- `npm run data:*` commands use TypeScript versions in `scripts/`
- `npm run quality:*` commands use shell scripts in `scripts/`
- `npx botct-resolve` command uses new path in `scripts/utilities/`

**No functionality lost** - all active development workflows preserved.
