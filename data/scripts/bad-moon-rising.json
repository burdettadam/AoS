  "description": "Bad Moon Rising is a death extravaganza. Demons kill multiple times per night, and Minions get in on the action too. Good players can take great risks to gain reliable information, but may accidentally kill their friends in the process. Luckily, there are many options to keep players alive long past their use-by date. If the good team cannot determine which specific Minions and Demons are in play, however, their doom is all but certain. Intermediate difficulty - recommended for players who are proactive, dedicated to working as a team, and don't fear dying.",

Kill up to 3 if no one voted to execute. 15) Pukka: Choose player - they are poisoned. Previously poisoned player dies. 16) Shabaloth: Choose 2 players - they die.
