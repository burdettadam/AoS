  "description": "Sects & Violets is the craziest of the three editions included in the base set. Good characters get amazing information each and every night. However, the evil team is extremely varied and threatening and can throw massive confusion into the mix. Characters change alignment. Players change characters. Even the evil team can lose track of who is who. This is also the first appearance of madness, which throws all manner of spanners into the works. Intermediate difficulty - recommended for players who want to do wild and unexpected things, pushing the limits of what can be achieved in a bluffing game.",
