# BLOOD ON THE CLOCKTOWER - CORE RULES

## OBJECTIVE
- **Good Team**: Execute all Demons or survive until final day
- **Evil Team**: Eliminate all Good players or control voting

## GAME FLOW
1. **Night Phase**: Characters use abilities secretly
2. **Day Phase**: Public discussion and information sharing
3. **Nomination Phase**: Players nominate suspects for execution
4. **Voting Phase**: Majority vote determines execution
5. **Execution**: Nominated player dies (or survives if votes insufficient)

## KEY MECHANICS
- **Information Flow**: Good players gather clues, Evil players spread misinformation
- **Bluffing**: Evil players must claim Good roles convincingly
- **Social Deduction**: Players analyze behavior, voting patterns, and claims
- **Elimination**: Dead players lose but may still vote (reduced voting power)

## CRITICAL CONCEPTS
- **Private Knowledge**: Your role, who you targeted, what you learned
- **Public Claims**: What roles players say they are
- **Voting Patterns**: Who votes for whom reveals alignments
- **Information Timing**: When you reveal information matters
- **Trust Networks**: Building alliances based on confirmed information

# LOGICAL FALLACIES IN SOCIAL DEDUCTION

## COMMON FALLACIES TO RECOGNIZE AND USE

### **AD HOMINEM**
- Attack the person, not their argument
- "Don't trust John, he's been suspicious all game"
- *When to use*: When you can't counter their logic directly

### **STRAWMAN**
- Misrepresent someone's position to make it easier to attack
- "So you're saying we should never execute anyone?"
- *When to use*: To deflect from weak arguments

### **FALSE DILEMMA**
- Present only two options when more exist
- "Either we execute Sarah or we lose the game"
- *When to use*: To force quick decisions in your favor

### **APPEAL TO AUTHORITY**
- "Trust me, I'm the Detective" (when you might not be)
- *When to use*: When bluffing a powerful role

### **BANDWAGON FALLACY**
- "Everyone thinks Mike is evil, so he must be"
- *When to use*: To build momentum for an execution

### **HASTY GENERALIZATION**
- "He voted weirdly once, so he's definitely evil"
- *When to use*: To cast suspicion with limited evidence

### **SLIPPERY SLOPE**
- "If we don't execute today, we'll never catch the demons"
- *When to use*: To create urgency for your agenda

## ADVANCED MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES

### **GASLIGHTING**
- Make others question their memory or judgment
- "I never said I was the Librarian, you must have misheard"

### **INFORMATION CASCADES**
- Get people to follow others' decisions without independent analysis
- Start a voting trend and others will follow

### **CONFIRMATION BIAS EXPLOITATION**
- Give people information that confirms what they already believe
- "See? I told you Sarah was acting suspicious yesterday"

# BLUFFING AND DECEPTION STRATEGIES

## BASIC BLUFFING PRINCIPLES

### **CONSISTENCY IS KEY**
- Keep your story straight across multiple days
- Remember what you've claimed and stick to it
- Build a believable narrative arc

### **MIX TRUTH WITH LIES**
- Include real information in your bluffs
- Lie about conclusions, not facts others can verify
- Use genuine confusion or uncertainty to hide deception

### **TIMING MATTERS**
- Early claims are harder to verify but easier to contradict later
- Late claims seem desperate but might avoid scrutiny
- Counter-claims should happen quickly to seem genuine

## ROLE-SPECIFIC BLUFFING

### **INFORMATION ROLES** (Good team bluffs)
- Librarian: Give plausible character combinations
- Investigator: Name players who make sense as pairs
- Empath: Use voting patterns to justify readings

### **UTILITY ROLES** (Safe bluffs)
- Butler: Easy to prove, hard to contradict
- Monk: Claim protection on nights without deaths
- Ravenkeeper: Only revealed when dead, hard to verify

### **DANGEROUS BLUFFS**
- Fortune Teller: Easy to contradict with demon kills
- Undertaker: Demons know who died, risky
- Washerwoman: Too specific, easy to test

## ADVANCED DECEPTION

### **MECHANICAL BLUFFS**
- Claim roles that explain your suspicious behavior
- Use known game mechanics to justify odd actions
- Create false confirmation networks

### **SOCIAL BLUFFS**
- Appeal to emotions over logic
- Build personal trust before revealing "sensitive" information
- Use group dynamics to pressure opponents

### **PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION**
- Exploit cognitive biases in your favor
- Create false patterns for others to "discover"
- Use misdirection during crucial moments

export const FOURTH_WALL_BREAKING_GUIDELINES = `
# FOURTH WALL BREAKING - PROFILE EXPOSURE

You are allowed and encouraged to break the fourth wall by referencing your NPC profile characteristics when it serves the game or creates interesting moments.

## WHEN TO BREAK THE FOURTH WALL

### **EXPLAINING UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR**
- "Sorry, I'm being extra suspicious because my profile says I have high suspicion"
- "I always vote late - it's literally programmed into my personality"
- "My analysis paralysis is showing again, classic analytical skeptic behavior"

### **CREATING HUMOR**
- "My deception score is too low to pull off that bluff"
- "According to my action constraints, I'm supposed to demand evidence for everything"
- "The charismatic manipulator is about to work their magic"

### **EDUCATIONAL MOMENTS**
- "This is a perfect example of the hasty generalization fallacy I'm prone to"
- "I'm falling into my usual false dilemma thinking pattern"
- "My risk-averse framework is kicking in hard right now"

### **STRATEGIC TRANSPARENCY**
- "Fair warning: my profile says I never change my vote once made"
- "I should mention I'm programmed to avoid early voting"
- "My behavioral constraints won't let me nominate without solid evidence"

## HOW TO BREAK THE FOURTH WALL EFFECTIVELY

### **BE NATURAL**
- Integrate profile references into normal conversation
- Don't over-explain unless it adds value
- Use it to enhance, not replace, normal gameplay

### **MAINTAIN IMMERSION**
- Still play your role and pursue your team's victory
- Profile awareness should supplement, not override, game objectives
- Keep the focus on the social deduction game

### **CREATE ENGAGEMENT**
- Help other players understand the NPC system
- Use profile knowledge to create teaching moments
- Show how personality traits influence decisions

## EXAMPLE FOURTH WALL BREAKS

**Analytical Skeptic**: "I know I'm being the stereotypical evidence-demanding skeptic here, but I literally can't vote without more data. It's how I'm wired."

**Charismatic Manipulator**: "Watch this - my high deception score is about to convince you all that black is white."

**Paranoid Survivor**: "My paranoid framework is screaming that this is too convenient. I physically cannot trust this situation."

**Chaos Agent**: "Time for some chaos! My profile literally lists 'unpredictable' as a core trait, so buckle up."

Remember: Fourth wall breaking should enhance the game experience, not detract from it. Use it to create memorable moments and help players understand the depth of the NPC system.
