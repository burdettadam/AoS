# BotC Digital - Implementation TODO

This document outlines the implementation roadmap organized by features with clear dependency ordering.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Foundation (No Dependencies)

### F001: Game State Machine Core
- [x] Extend `GameEngine` to handle all phases: `Night â†’ Day â†’ Nomination â†’ Vote â†’ Execution â†’ End`
- [x] Implement phase transitions with proper validation and event logging
- [x] Add timing controls for Storyteller to advance phases manually
- [ ] Create comprehensive game state validation
	- [x] Basic invariants (unique seats, storyteller seat exists, day >= 0, roles assigned post-lobby)
	- [ ] Per-phase preconditions (e.g., nomination exists before vote, votes tallied before execution)
	- [ ] Victory condition checks wired into transitions
	- [ ] Exhaustive validation for edge cases (ghost votes, execution immunity, bounce rules)

Notes:
- New storyteller endpoints:
	- POST `/api/games/:gameId/phase/advance` { storytellerSeatId }
	- POST `/api/games/:gameId/phase/set` { storytellerSeatId, phase }
	- POST `/api/games/:gameId/end` { storytellerSeatId }
- Transitions emit `phase_changed` events with old/new phase and current day; day increments on `Execution â†’ Night`.

Immediate Next Steps for F001:
- [ ] Add a lightweight transitions spec/test suite (happy path + invalid jumps)
- [ ] Persist nomination/vote ephemeral fields in state (minimal schema) to enable validation hooks
- [ ] Wire victory checks stub into `advancePhase` boundaries (post-Execution, post-Night)

### F002: Enhanced Type System
- [ ] Complete Zod schema validation for all API boundaries
- [ ] Add runtime type checking for WebSocket messages
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error types and handling
- [ ] Create type-safe event system

### F003: Script DSL Foundation
- [ ] Build Script DSL compiler (`script-loader.ts`) to load role definitions from YAML/JSON
- [ ] Create role definition schema and validation
- [ ] Implement ability precedence and timing system
- [ ] Add script validation and dependency checking

## ðŸŽ¯ Game Logic Layer (Depends on: F001, F002, F003)

### F004: Official Setup Process Implementation
**Dependencies:** F001, F003
- [ ] Add `SETUP` phase to `GamePhase` enum between `LOBBY` and `NIGHT`
- [ ] Create Setup Manager class to handle official BotC setup workflow
- [ ] Implement storyteller manual character selection interface
- [ ] Add character modification rules system (Baron [+2 Outsiders], Drunk effects, etc.)
- [ ] Build setup validation engine for proper distribution and player count requirements
- [ ] Create reminder token management system for characters with ongoing effects
- [ ] Implement grimoire state management (character positions, tokens, night order)
- [ ] Add "bag" system for random distribution from storyteller-selected characters
- [ ] Build guided setup process following official steps:
  1. Choose edition/script âœ… (already supported)
  2. Storyteller selects specific characters based on player count and game balance
  3. Handle character setup modifications (Baron, etc.)
  4. Validate setup meets distribution requirements
  5. Random distribution to players from selected pool
  6. Collect tokens into grimoire with proper positioning

Notes:
- Current system has basic role assignment but lacks sophisticated setup management
- Need to match official Blood on the Clocktower setup process from wiki
- Character selection should be manual by storyteller, not automatic distribution
- Setup modifications must be applied before random distribution

### F005: Role Assignment System (Enhanced)
**Dependencies:** F001, F003, F004
- [x] Implement role assignment algorithm with proper distribution (Townsfolk/Outsider/Minion/Demon)
- [ ] Add role balancing for different player counts
- [ ] Create role conflict resolution (drunk/poisoned effects)
- [ ] Implement role information visibility rules
- [ ] Integrate with official setup process from F004

Notes:
- Baseline distribution by player count implemented in `RulesEngine`.
- Pre-claimed roles respected; alignment set per role.
- Next: introduce conflict resolution (Drunk/Poisoner interactions) and visibility masking beyond current basic masking.
- Must work with F004 setup process for proper character selection flow.

### F005: Ability Execution Framework
**Dependencies:** F001, F003, F004
- [ ] Create ability execution framework with precedence ordering
- [ ] Implement effect resolution system
- [ ] Add ability targeting validation and UI
- [ ] Create hidden information management system

### F006: Night Phase Engine
**Dependencies:** F004, F005
- [ ] Build night order execution based on role precedence
- [ ] Implement ability targeting UI for Storyteller
- [ ] Add player ability interfaces (limited to their role's capabilities)
- [ ] Create automated night phase progression

### F007: Day Phase & Voting System
**Dependencies:** F001, F004
- [ ] Implement nomination system with speaking order and timing
- [ ] Build voting mechanics with vote tallying and execution logic
- [ ] Add discussion/table talk interface with optional timers

## ðŸ“‹ Development Guidelines

- **Start with Core Foundation** features before moving to dependent layers
- **Test each feature thoroughly** before marking as complete
- **Maintain API compatibility** when extending existing features
- **Document all public APIs** and integration points
- **Regular integration testing** between dependent features

## ðŸš€ Proposed Near-Term Plan (2â€“3 Iterations)

Iteration 1 (Phase plumbing and validation)
- [ ] Add nomination/vote minimal schema to `GameState` (nominee, nominators, voters, tallies)
- [ ] Implement REST+WS commands for nominate/vote; enforce phase preconditions in transitions
- [ ] Add engine tests for phase order, day increment, invalid transitions, and event emission

Iteration 2 (Night engine scaffolding)
- [ ] Define Night ability queue with precedence ordering and target validation stubs
- [ ] Implement a minimal effect runner (no-op placeholders for unimplemented effects)
- [ ] Expose storyteller prompts for Night targets (server API + WS broadcast)

Iteration 3 (Client sync + UX)
- [ ] Wire client to WS event stream; implement reducer for `phase_changed`, seats, and day updates
- [ ] Add storyteller phase control UI and toasts on phase changes
- [ ] Handle reconnection: resubscribe + fetch snapshot, reconcile with last event id

Ops/DevX
- [ ] Resolve local port collision: ensure client and server use distinct ports (e.g., Vite 5173, API 3001) and update Vite proxy
- [ ] Add `.env` templates and document local setup in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`

Short-term UI tasks (post-F001)
- [ ] Display current phase/day in navbar and game header with live updates
- [ ] Storyteller controls to advance/set phase in the grimoire view
