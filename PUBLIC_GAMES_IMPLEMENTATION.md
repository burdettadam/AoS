# Public Games Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the requested features that allow users to:
1. **See a list of public games they can join when logged in**
2. **Configure a game they are creating to be private**

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Model Updates

**File: `packages/shared/src/game-state.ts`**
- Added `isPublic: z.boolean().default(true)` field to GameState schema
- Updated both TypeScript and compiled JavaScript versions

### 2. Backend API Changes

**File: `packages/server/src/game/engine.ts`**
- Updated `createGame()` method to accept `options?: { isPublic?: boolean }` parameter
- Added `getPublicGames()` method that filters games by `isPublic: true` and `phase: LOBBY`

**File: `packages/server/src/services/matchmaking.ts`** 
- Updated `createGame()` method to pass through privacy options
- Added `getPublicGames()` method to expose filtered public games

**File: `packages/server/src/index.ts`**
- Added new endpoint: `GET /api/games/public` - returns only public games in lobby phase
- Updated `POST /api/games` to accept `isPublic` parameter (defaults to true)

### 3. Frontend UI Changes

**File: `packages/client/src/pages/HomePage.tsx`**
- Added privacy toggle radio buttons to game creation form:
  - "Public - Anyone can find and join" 
  - "Private - Join by invite only"
- Added explanatory help text that updates based on selection
- Added new "Join Public Games" section that displays:
  - List of available public games with game name, script, player count, and phase
  - Refresh button to reload the list
  - Join buttons for each game
  - Empty state message when no public games are available
- Added state management for `isPublic`, `publicGames`, and `loadingGames`
- Added `fetchPublicGames()` function that calls `/api/games/public`
- Added `handleJoinPublicGame()` function for joining games from the list

### 4. Testing

**File: `tests/smoke-test-public-games.sh`**
- Created comprehensive smoke test script that verifies:
  - Public games can be created and appear in public games list
  - Private games can be created and do NOT appear in public games list  
  - API endpoints return correct data
  - Game privacy settings work as expected

## Features Delivered

### ✅ Public Games List
- Authenticated users see a "Join Public Games" section on the homepage
- Shows game name, script type, player count, phase, and creation time
- Refresh button to get latest games
- Join button for each game (requires player name to be set)
- Empty state when no public games available

### ✅ Privacy Settings
- Game creation form includes privacy toggle with clear labels
- Public games (default): "Anyone can find and join"
- Private games: "Join by invite only" 
- Help text explains the difference
- Privacy setting is sent to backend and stored in game state

### ✅ API Implementation
- `GET /api/games/public` - Returns only public games in lobby phase
- `POST /api/games` - Accepts `isPublic` parameter (defaults to true)
- Games have `isPublic` field in database schema
- Filtering works correctly (private games excluded from public list)

## Testing Results

## Architecture Notes

- **Default Behavior**: Games are public by default to encourage community interaction
- **Privacy Control**: Only the game creator can set privacy during game creation
- **Filtering**: Public games list only shows games in "lobby" phase (joinable state)
- **Security**: Private games are completely hidden from public discovery
- **UX**: Clear visual feedback and help text guide users through privacy choices

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Game search/filtering in public games list
- Game categories or tags
- Player skill level matching
- Game status indicators (e.g., "Waiting for players", "Starting soon")
- Pagination for large numbers of public games
