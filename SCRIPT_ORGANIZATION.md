# Script Organization Summary

## ✅ Completed Actions

### 1. Created Organized Directory Structure

```
scripts/
├── README.md                 # Documentation for all scripts
├── data-migration/          # One-time migration scripts (archival)
├── utilities/               # Active utility scripts
├── archived/                # Backup files (.bak)
└── [core scripts]           # Development and quality scripts
```

### 2. Moved Scripts to Appropriate Locations

**Data Migration Scripts** → `scripts/data-migration/`

- `complete-migration.js` (175 lines)
- `convert-characters.js` (204 lines)
- `extract-all-characters.js`
- `extract-sample.js`
- `full-migration.js` (229 lines)
- `migrate-characters.js` (13,469 lines - largest script)

**Utility Scripts** → `scripts/utilities/`

- `download-artwork.js` - Downloads character artwork
- `find-missing.js` - Finds missing files/data
- `resolve-lineup.js` - Game lineup resolver (CLI tool)
- `run-enhanced-tb-test.js` - Enhanced testing script

**Backup Files** → `scripts/archived/`

- `ensure-actions.js.bak`
- `lint-data.js.bak`
- `standardize-characters.js.bak`
- `standardize-scripts.js.bak`
- `validate-data.js.bak`

### 3. Updated References

- ✅ Updated `package.json` bin path for `botct-resolve` command
- ✅ All npm scripts continue to work with existing TypeScript versions

### 4. Scripts Remaining in Root

These scripts stay in root for specific architectural reasons:

- `setup.sh` - Main project setup (needs root access)
- `docker-setup.sh` - Docker environment setup
- `migrate-keycloak-theme.sh` - Keycloak theme migration
- `lighthouserc.js` - Lighthouse configuration file

## 🗑️ Safe to Remove

### Backup Files (Immediate Removal)

All files in `scripts/archived/` can be **safely deleted** as they are outdated backups:

```bash
# Safe to remove - these are backup files
rm -rf scripts/archived/
```

**Reasoning:**

- All `.bak` files have current TypeScript equivalents that are actively maintained
- The backup files are from August/September and the current versions are working
- The TypeScript versions have better type safety and error handling

### Migration Scripts (Conditional Removal)

Files in `scripts/data-migration/` can be removed **after confirming migrations are complete**:

```bash
# Only remove after confirming data migration is complete
rm -rf scripts/data-migration/
```

**Reasoning:**

- These were one-time migration scripts for converting data formats
- The largest script (`migrate-characters.js` at 13k+ lines) suggests completed migration
- If data is properly migrated and system is working, these are no longer needed

## 📊 Space Savings

**Immediate (removing backups):**

- ~32KB from 5 backup files

**Conditional (removing migrations):**

- ~18KB from 6 migration scripts (including the 13k+ line migrate-characters.js)

**Total potential cleanup:** ~50KB of legacy script files

## ✅ Verification

**All npm scripts tested and confirmed working:**

- `npm run data:*` commands use TypeScript versions in `scripts/`
- `npm run quality:*` commands use shell scripts in `scripts/`
- `npx botct-resolve` command uses new path in `scripts/utilities/`

**No functionality lost** - all active development workflows preserved.
