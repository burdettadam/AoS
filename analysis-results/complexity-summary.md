# Code Complexity Analysis Report

Generated on: Wed Sep 24 09:36:51 MDT 2025

## Overview
This report provides an analysis of code complexity and quality issues in the Blood on the Clocktower Digital project.

## ESLint Complexity Analysis

### Key Metrics
- Functions with high complexity (>10):        0
- Functions with deep nesting (>4):        0
- Files with too many lines (>300):        0
- Functions with too many parameters (>4):        0

### Analysis Focus Areas
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Functions exceeding complexity threshold of 10
- **Nesting Depth**: Code blocks nested deeper than 4 levels
- **File Length**: Files exceeding 300 lines
- **Parameter Count**: Functions with more than 4 parameters

## Recommendations
1. Break down complex functions into smaller, focused functions
2. Reduce nesting depth through early returns and guard clauses
3. Split large files into smaller, more cohesive modules
4. Consider using object parameters for functions with many parameters
5. Add unit tests for complex functions to ensure maintainability
